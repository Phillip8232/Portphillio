### <u>Design Documentation including</u>

<u>**Design process**</u>

I created a mood board to get idea's of colours or how i wanted to make the website look i then moved to creating the wire frames for website once i finished with the wire frame i moved to building the website as i was building the website i made slight changes to how it was intended to look but kept the layout the same.

I then moved on to creating the design process of the phone when i was happy with it i started to build it as  i was building the website on the phone i also made slight changes and improvement to the design when i was happy i uploaded it to a sub domain called Netlify.

I then later sent a couple of website links to my friends as a way to get feed back concerning bugs and issues regarding responsiveness after a few hours of testing they then sent me issues regarding the responsiveness of the website which i later fixed.
